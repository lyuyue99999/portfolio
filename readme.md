# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases two of my key projects that demonstrate my skills in web development and app interaction design.

## Project 1: Midterm Assignment - Web Development

For my midterm assignment, I embarked on a web development project where I was tasked with creating a login page, a charity page, and a project page. This project was particularly challenging as it required me to delve into CSS animations using keyframes to display two images sequentially. Despite being a newcomer to this technique, I was determined to implement it to enhance the visual appeal of the pages. Through trial and error, coupled with extensive research and experimentation, I successfully incorporated the animations into the project. This experience not only bolstered my proficiency in HTML and CSS but also provided me with invaluable insights into the intricacies of front-end development.

## Project 2: Pet Boarding Company App - Interaction Design

In my second project, I shifted my focus to interaction design for a pet boarding company app. This endeavor introduced me to the versatile capabilities of Figma, a powerful tool for creating app prototypes and implementing interactive content. From wireframing to finalizing the design, I meticulously crafted each element of the app to ensure a seamless user experience. One of the highlights of this project was my foray into logo design, where I had the opportunity to conceptualize and create a visually captivating logo for the company. This venture marked my inaugural attempt at logo design, and the positive feedback I received affirmed my passion for graphic design. Through this project, I not only honed my skills in app prototyping but also gained a newfound appreciation for the artistry involved in branding and visual identity.

## Reflections on the Portfolio Creation Process

The process of developing my portfolio website was an enriching journey that enabled me to refine my technical skills and expand my creative horizons. Leveraging CSS frameworks and libraries, I meticulously crafted each page, ensuring a harmonious blend of aesthetics and functionality. Along the way, I encountered various challenges, from fine-tuning the layout to addressing compatibility issues across different browsers. However, with perseverance and resilience, I overcame these obstacles, emerging with a polished and cohesive portfolio that reflects my capabilities and aspirations. This experience not only solidified my understanding of front-end development but also instilled in me a sense of confidence in tackling future projects.

## Future Endeavors

As I continue to evolve as a developer and designer, I am eager to embark on new challenges and explore emerging technologies. My portfolio serves as a testament to my passion for innovation and my dedication to delivering exceptional solutions. Whether it's creating captivating web experiences or designing intuitive mobile interfaces, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of creativity and excellence.
